Here are the main key points from the video on MAC addresses:

Definition: MAC stands for Media Access Control, and it is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface card (NIC).
Physical Address: Unlike IP addresses, which can change, MAC addresses are considered physical addresses, permanently assigned by the manufacturer.
Structure: A MAC address is 48 bits long (6 bytes), divided into two sections: the first 24 bits identify the vendor (Organizationally Unique Identifier), and the last 24 bits are a unique value assigned by the vendor s .

Types of MAC Addresses:
Unicast: A unique MAC address for a specific device.
Multicast: A MAC address used for applications or protocols that only certain devices will listen to.
Broadcast: A MAC address that sends data to all devices on a network, represented as all F's s .

Display Formats: MAC addresses can be displayed in different formats, such as:
Colon-separated (Linux/Apple)
Dash-separated (Microsoft)
Grouped in fours (Cisco) s .

Communication Layers: MAC addresses are used for local communication (Layer 2), while IP addresses are used for global communication (Layer 3) s .
Checking MAC Address: On Windows, you can check your MAC address by using the command ipconfig /all in the command prompt or PowerShell s .
